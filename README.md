"# Code-Fruit-for-Visual-Studio" 

This adds fruit themed syntax highlighting to Visual Studio.

In Visual Studio, choose Tools > Import and Export Settings

Choose Import Selected Environment Settings and select whether you want to back up your existing settings or not

Click Browse... to choose the file you downloaded.

You get a choice which settings you want to import - choose all of them since the file only contains color settings and won't touch your other VS settings.

Click Finish and you'll see the new colors.
